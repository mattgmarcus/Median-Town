From a cultural anthropological perspective, we want to understand how manga and anime texts constitute a culture in a distinctive way and how it relates to existing sociohistorical conditions and aesthetic traditions. We may also call this culture otaku culture, in so far as this is how some of its participants and observers habitually describe it today.Contemporary otaku cultural experience and sensibility touch on a wide variety of issues and ideas including nationalism, globalization, locality, technology, gender, subjectivity, postwar history, death, the human, the animal, and the inanimate. As such, the culture of anime and manga is not simply a convenient window through which to explore Japanese culture but is itself a heterogeneous site of cultural action, norms, desires, aesthetics, economy, and politics.

In particular, we will be interested in the personal, everyday, and affective dimensions of memory-making practices and narratives. What does history look like when viewed through the lens of everyday practices and personal desires? How should we account for the relationship between macrohistories of social groups and microhistories of personal, idiosyncratic experience? Drawing on social history, cultural anthropology, studies in autobiography, and material culture studies, we explore diverse topics such as: postwar/postcolonial politics of memory; life history writing; trauma and healing; archives, monuments, and mementos; nostalgia; funerary practices.

Drawing on linguistic anthropology, sociolinguistics, literary studies, and semiotics, we seek to understand complex conditions of power relations that shape and are shaped by the way people in Japan communicate (pragmatics) and reflexively talk about communication (meta-pragmatics). Our basic aim is to analytically delineate the meta-pragmatic/ hegemonic stereotype of Japan as a homogeneous ethnolinguistic community and to consider critical alternatives to it. We will explore ethnographic accounts of heterogeneous sites of language-in-use, and address issues such as language standardization, globalization, gender and race relations, subcultures, affect, and political economy.Dist: LIT; WCult: NW.

From Robin Hood via actual and legendary robbers, pirates, and corsair in the 17th and 18th centuries, to present day pirates, terrorists and guerilla groups in Somalia, Latin America, Italy, Germany, and the U.S., individuals have always been involved in what they considered legitimate (though illegal) resistance against poverty, authority, patriarchy, feudalism, capitalism, and imperialism.

The political transitions that were set in motion in the Middle East and North Africa in December 2010--collectively described as the Arab Spring or the Arab Uprising--are but the beginning of a long process of adjustments local regimes and societies will need to make to account for greater, and more viable, demands for accountability and transparency of local rulers.It is virtually impossible, however, to understand both the emergence of this latest wave of contestation in the Arab world and its likely future without comprehending first the emergence of the highly authoritarian regimes in the Middle East since the region's independence roughly half a century ago. The first part of this course covers this historical emergence of middle eastern regimes since the early 1950s.In each country--Libya, Tunisia,Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, Morocco, Algeria--elites have responded differently to the uprising, depending in part on the institutional repertoire each country possessed. As yet, it is unclear what the different trajectories of each country's period of upheaval will be, but they all share important common political elements and developments: transitional arrangements as the first phase of contestation comes to an end, proposed elections leading to constitution-making processes and to referendums that are meant to introduce--or re-introduce--forms of constitutional government.In order to understand this protracted process we will study the mechanics of transition through a comparative case-study approach in particularly Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, and Bahrain. Peripherally we also study the question of why the Arab Gulf states have been relatively immune from popular uprisings, and we incorporate in our discussion as well the role international actors (the United Nations, the Arab League, the African Union, the European Union) have played in the unfolding of the uprisings and beyond.

We will look in depth at both developed and developing countries, with an emphasis on understanding why they choose (or end up with) the policies and institutions that they have, even when in some cases these policies and institutions might hamper development or increase poverty. The central goal of this course is to develop students' ability to reason through political explanations of economic policies. Sorens.In 13F at 10. Democracy in Developing Countries. Although modern democracy is a western invention, it is now the dominant form of government in the world, and most democracies do not resemble their western counterparts. What are the implications of these differences in the daily practice of democracy? How does democracy concretely work in countries with high levels of poverty, conflict, inequality, ethnic diversity and/or illiteracy? How does democracy in \"developing countries\" diverge from western ideals and western realities? Drawing on the experience of countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, the class will compare and discuss the way democracy is practiced in developing countries. We will explore a number of themes, including how citizens understand democracy, political culture, clientelism/patronage, corruption, electoral violence, accountability, and ethnic voting.

All democracies share important features (e.g., elections), but they also differ in significant ways (e.g., party systems, constitutional arrangements, power). Many of the patterns typical of European democracies are unfamiliar to Americans. In this course, we will explore how the major European countries \"do\" democracy. How did they get there? How does parliamentary government work? How do citizens participate in the political process? What issues do European elites and electorates view as central and what sorts of policy options have been proposed in response? How \"European\" are Europeans? Dist: INT or SOC WCult: W. Sa'adah.In 14W and 15W. Global Public Opinion.There has been a rise in attention to the role of global public opinion in international relations. News media usage of the phrase world public opinion or global public opinion, as well as scholarly research about it, dramatically increased during the last decade. But has global public opinion actually played an important role in international affairs, particularly since September 11, 2001? What are the attitudes of citizens around the world towards some crucial global issues that require international cooperation? Do their attitudes substantially affect states ability to cooperate to address such issues? In this course, by examining these questions through extensive readings and class discussions, students will learn important theories and empirical findings on global public opinion. Since most assigned papers are based on statistical analysis, students are expected to have taken a course on statistical methods (e.g., Government 10).

Ethics, Everyday Life and Law. What is the right thing to do? What is the best way of life? How, if at all, should the answers to these questions bear on politics and law? Some hold that morality is intensely demanding, and asks us to overcome the natural concern for ourselves and those close to us. Others argue that the moral life is simple and relatively easy to comply with. Are morally excellent people happier-or is happiness beside the point of morality. Does a political community that enshrines the \"pursuit of happiness\" as among its foundational goals need to take a concern with the moral character of citizens?

But we lack a deep understanding of the bridge that must link these two sides of the \"mind-body\" problem. We do not yet fully understand (1) how information is processed, transformed and communicated by neurons, (2) how consciousness can be realized in physical neuronal activity, or (3) how mental events realized in physical brain events can be causal of subsequent mental and physical events. This course will focus on what is known about the neural code and the neural bases of consciousness, mental causation and free will and what is not yet understood. We will focus on reading original research articles and chapters from books that attempt to get at these deep and challenging conceptual and empirical issues. A particular focus will be the relationship of attentional processing to consciousness, and its neural bases.

Traditionally, war has been constructed as powerfully gendered binary in which battle is posed as a nearly sacred and exclusively male domain through which young men are initiated into the masculine gender and the male bond. From the west's great classical war narrative of The Iliad onward, the feminine has, by contrast, been defined as that which instigates male-male conflict and that which wars are fought either to save or protect, be it a war to rescue Helen of Troy, to avenge the raped women of Kuwait whose plight was invoked as a cause for the l991 Gulf War, one to protect the faithful (or faithless and betraying) wife at home, or a war to defend the ultimate national repository of the feminine ideal to be protected from the rapacious invasions of the enemy: America the Beautiful, mother land and virgin land. As a counterpart to the protection of the feminine imagined as belonging to one's own males, the narrative either tacitly or overtly allows a soldier to view the all \"enemy\" women as objects to be raped; and in the most recent wars of ethnic genocide of the 1990s onward, women in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Sudan have become no longer just incidental victims or \"collateral damage,\" but the primary objects of enemy destruction. Starting with the Gulf War, however, the strict spatialization of the American war myth was at least challenged by the new presence of women on the war front, women as POWs, and in the present war in Iraq, women coming home maimed and in body bags; and women have now been integratedwhether successfully or not-- into all of the U. S. military accredited academies.

During this time Greeks confronted a series of demographic, political, social, and economic challenges and generated an array of responses that fundamentally changed the ways in which they lived, worked, and interacted. Much of what we now see as distinctive about Greek culturedemocracy, stone temples, and nude athletics, to name but a fewfirst came into being between the mid-eighth and the early fifth centuries BCE.This course focuses on Sparta and Corinth, two city-states that, despite their geographic proximity, followed notably different developmental trajectories during the Archaic period. Sparta conquered much of the southern Peloponnese and became a militarized society with an economy based almost entirely on agriculture. Corinths territory was, compared to that of Sparta, minuscule, but it became a powerful and wealthy community through the foundation of numerous colonies and the exploitation of its location for commerce. Sparta was famed for its army, Corinth for its navy. Spartans were known for the simplicity of their lifestyle and the almost rural character of their urban center, whereas Corinthians notoriously enjoyed luxuries of all kinds, were pioneers in the development of the Greeks earliest large-scale stone temples, and converted their urban nucleus and its associated ports into the Archaic Greek mainlands principal trade hub. By comparing and contrasting Sparta and Corinth, we can develop a good sense of the Greek world during a period that has been aptly described as an age of experiment.Careful study of the development of Sparta and Corinth during the Archaic period requires making thorough use of methodologies taken from two different fields: archaeology and history. In simple terms, archaeology explores the past on the basis of material remains such as pottery and architecture, whereas history conducts its investigation of bygone eras by relying principally on written texts. This course draws heavily on both archaeological and historical methodologies. There is an ample collection of relevant material; Corinth and Sparta have both been the object of long-lasting programs of excavation that began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, respectively, and both cities attracted considerable attention from ancient Greek authors.The faculty members teaching this course, one an archaeologist and the other an historian, will make a consistent effort to familiarize you with how we might go about using material remains and texts to explore the development of Sparta and Corinth during the Archaic period. We will consider the different narratives that can be constructed by way of material remains on the one hand and texts on the other, as well as how those narratives may complement or alternatively contradict each other.There are no pre-requisites for this course, nor do prospective students require any previous familiarity with the ancient Mediterranean world.", "title": "Early Corinth and Sparta: A Comparative Approach to the History and Archaeology of Two Major Greek City-States"}, "EARS 87": {"description": "Available every term as advanced study in a particular field of the earth sciences, not related to Senior Thesis research, and under the supervision of a faculty advisor.

Traditionally, war has been constructed as powerfully gendered binary in which battle is posed as a nearly sacred and exclusively male domain through which young men are initiated into the masculine gender and the male bond. From the west's great classical war narrative of The Iliad onward, the feminine has, by contrast, been defined as that which instigates male-male conflict and that which wars are fought either to save or protect, be it a war to rescue Helen of Troy, to avenge the raped women of Kuwait whose plight was invoked as a cause for the l991 Gulf War, one to protect the faithful (or faithless and betraying) wife at home, or a war to defend the ultimate national repository of the feminine ideal to be protected from the rapacious invasions of the enemy: America the Beautiful, mother land and virgin land. As a counterpart to the protection of the feminine imagined as belonging to one's own males, the narrative either tacitly or overtly allows a soldier to view the all \"enemy\" women as objects to be raped; and in the most recent wars of ethnic genocide of the 1990s onward, women in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Sudan have become no longer just incidental victims or \"collateral damage,\" but the primary objects of enemy destruction. Starting with the Gulf War, however, the strict spatialization of the American war myth was at least challenged by the new presence of women on the war front, women as POWs, and in the present war in Iraq, women coming home maimed and in body bags; and women have now been integratedwhether successfully or not-- into all of the U. S. military accredited academies.

For some, the genre provides an imaginative space for avenging the offenses of colonization. For others, it offers a democratized landscape where all are equal, where American law is malleable, and where intelligence and subversion triumph. While most critics applaud these decolonizing efforts, we will examine their darker implications as well: do these narratives do real cultural work, or do they simply cash in on a thrill-seeking, stereotype-infested, pop-cultural industry? Do such works reveal that colonial violence will beget only more-and bloodier-violence? And in the end, who are its true victims?Dist: LIT; WCult: Cl.

The artistic corollary to the Black Power movement, the Black Arts Movement flourished in the 1960s and 1970s as artists/activists sought to put a revolutionary cultural politics into practice around the country. The Black Arts Movement had far-reaching implications for the way artists and writers think aboutrace, history, authorship, and the relationship between artistic production and political liberation. We'll explore these issues in work by Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Larry Neal, and others who forged the traditionally-defined Black Arts Movement in Harlem. We'll also trace the movement's flowering around country, where local political struggles and artistic traditions in Chicago, Newark, Los Angeles, and Detroit shaped distinctive regional variations of the Black Arts Movement. We'll consider how the literature of the Black Arts Movement intersected with other cultural currents of the time, its critics, and the persistence of its themes in contemporary culture.Dist: LIT; WCult: W.

These concerns include (but are not limited to) notions of exile, the importance of language and music, the articulation of identity in varying post-colonial states, and representations of gender, race and ethnicity. The class will also analyze the socio-political events in particular nations and the ways in which these events influence writing in the archipelago. Furthermore, the course will explore shared cultural practices. For example, we will examine the ways in which a strong tradition of music as protest influences the production of particular poetic forms in Trinidad and Jamaica. The class will move from early twentieth century writers like Claude McKay to the important contributions of later writers such as Kamau Brathwaite, Jamaica Kincaid, George Lamming, V.S.

It reflects the broad variety of historical, political, social and cultural experiences that Jews from very different places and backgrounds brought to the United States. The course introduces students to the central topics, motives and literary strategies from the beginnings of a tangible Jewish American literature in the late nineteenth century to the present. The course is divided into four parts: 1. The Great Tide (1880-1920) discerns the literary repercussions of Jewish immigration such as language (Yiddish, Hebrew, English), religion (Judaism, secularism), and politics (Zionism, democracy) in the writings of authors such as Antin, Cahan, Kallen, Lazarus, Leeser, Mayer Wise, and Yezierska. 2. From Margin to Mainstream (1920-1945), covers the cataclysmic interwar years, which evoked an intensive production of the literary and literal children of immigrants coming of age and becoming an aesthetic and political force in debates about American modernism, among them Gertrude Stein and Henry Roth. 3. In the Years of Achievement and Ambivalence (1945-1970), the defining line of Jewish American writing altered dramatically. Jewish American literature's \"ethnic stamp\" marks and complicates the characters and perspectives created by Bellow, Ginsberg, Mailer, Malamud, Olsen, Paley, Singer and others with respect to debates about the Holocaust, the counterculture, or the civil rights, women's, and student movement. 4. Wandering and Return (1970 to the Present) will focus on the broad variety of modern and postmodern Jewish American writing. Questions of contemporary ethnic identity in a multicultural society as well as attempts to reconfigure historical perspectives on the Holocaust, the Rosenberg Case, or McCarthyism inform the writings of Doctorow, Lelchuk, Ozick, Philip Roth and others.Dist: LIT.

The contexts of the colonial encounter and its postcolonial aftermath will set the stage for our examination of the ways in which social, political, economic, and cultural factors foster the production of specific masculinities. Texts include Achebe's Things Fall Apart, Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Lafferiere's How to Make Love to a Negro, and additional writings by Irish, Indian, and Australian authors. Our study will be organized around the questions of the production of hegemonic and subaltern masculinities, the representation of the colonial and postcolonial male body, the militarization of masculinity, and the relation between masculinity and nationalism.

In this course we will read a series of indisputably \"great\" texts in order to understand the complex forms of evaluation (aesthetic, political, moral and commercial) that both underpin and revise notions of canonicity. Drawing on theoretical work by Gauri Viswanathan, Pierre Bourdieu, Theodor Adorno and Pascale Casanova, we will also consider the varied institutional contexts (from the colonial civil service to the liberal arts classroom, from small presses to multinational publishers, from Masterpiece Theater to contemporary Bollywood) that govern these processes.Dist: LIT; WCult: W.

Taking our cue from Adrienne Rich, who ambiguously titles one book of essays On Lies, Secrets and Silences (is she for or against?), we will follow debates about what makes it possible to break previous silences--and to what degree and in what ways it is useful or satisfying to do so.

We will read in the work of eight or nine poets and recent critical and theoretical writings, with some attention in the first weeks to important female and male precursors.

Engaging with postcolonial, feminist, and queer theory, we also read in the field of science and technology studies. Readings include not only a number of science fiction novels, short stories, and films by people of color across the Americas, but also a broader set of \"scientific fictions.\" For example, we read work by Afro-Caribbean-Canadian writer Nalo Hopkinson alongside postcolonial critiques of the so-called \"digital divide.\" Similarly, we read the speculative fiction of Karen Tei Yamashita, a California native who also lived in Brazil and Japan, against the backdrop of U.S. imperialism in Latin America and the fictions of \"development\" used to rationalize such endeavors. African-American writers Octavia Butler and Samuel Delany offer helpful counter-texts to the history of medical experimentation on people of color in the U.S. and the homophobia of AIDS discourse in the 1980s. In essence, we look to the speculative fiction by people of color as examples of what Hopkinson has termed \"postcolonial science fiction,\" which re-imagines science and technology in the service of transnational networks rather than Empire.Dist: LIT; WCult: CI.
